            <h2>COVID-19 Report Generator</h2>
            <p>
              This is a natural language report generator that generates a short
              snapshot report of COVID-19 given a specific location and date.
              <br />
              <br />
              The goal of this generator is help people better understand the
              situation of COVID-19 and take proper measures under different
              circumstances. By this generator, people can simply spend a few
              minitues reading the report instead of getting lost in enormous
              data.
              <br />
              <br />
              This generator includes two parts, a data processor and a natural
              language processor. The data processor is responsible for
              pre-processing of data related to COVID-19. It first collects data
              from public COVID-19 dataset like
              <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data"
                ><i>New York Times Coronavirus Dataset</i></a
              >, then processes data according to different algorithms, and
              finally stores results as csv files. <br />
              <br />
              The natural language processor is reponsible for generating a
              four-paragraphs report based on the processed data. The generated
              report includes tendency, comparation, suggestions, facts and
              basically everything a person need in the pandemic.
              <br /><br />
              The following is an example of the report:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              Health department reported a total of 128 new COVID-19 fatalities
              on Thursday 23 April 2020 in California, which brings the total
              number of COVID-19 fatalities across the state to 1,553. It is
              currently ranked 8 in the nation, following Illinois and
              Connecticut. Based on the data from the past ten days, cumulative
              deaths of this region is in a rising channel and today's data
              shows a sign of upward breakthrough.
              <br /><br />
              It is newly reported that growth rate climbed to 40. 5%, going up
              by 2. 8%, which is slightly higher than that of last week.
              Similarly, it is newly reported that newly confirmed cases climbed
              to 11,392, going up by 43. 3%, which is dramatically higher than
              that of last week. It is hard to say that situation is getting
              better, and people living in related regions shall keep track of
              further updates on COVID-19. In addition, cumulative death cases
              recorded 1,553 in total. Similarly, cumulative confirmed cases
              recorded 39,534 in total. According to the current situation, it
              may still take some time before people can return to normal social
              lives. Finally, based on the latest statistics on fatality rate, a
              drop by 3. 8% can be observed from last week's 5. 3%, which may
              indicate a downward trend. However, newly death cases, which is
              currently 582, has had a enormously rise of 37. 6% compared to
              last week. <br /><br />
              Moreover, counties in California are in different epidemic
              situations. Los Angeles county is responsible for 68 newly
              fatality cases on Thursday 23 April 2020, amounting to about 53
              percent of the stateâ€™s total newly fatality cases. San Diego
              county ranked the second, only 52 cases less than Los Angeles
              county. On the other end of the list, Kern county has 1 newly
              fatality cases on Thursday 23 April 2020. Still, it has far fewer
              newly fatality cases tied to COVID-19 than all the other counties
              in California. In conclusion, the epidemic in Kern is relatively
              controllable and preventable, while those of Los Angeles and San
              Diego are much more serious. Citizens living in Los Angeles and
              San Diego should strictly follow the instructions of state
              governments and reduce unnecessary outdoor activities.
